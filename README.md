# SCADA_Optimization_AI
This repository applies AI to optimize SCADA-based production processes. It identifies input-output relationships, determines optimal values, and enhances efficiency using ML models like Random Forest and L-BFGS-B optimization. Key insights include feature importance, correlation analysis, and predictive modeling to improve production quality.
